# ✈️ Flight Delays – Time Analysis Dashboard

## 🧭 Project Overview
This project explores flight delay patterns over time to identify trends, seasonal variations, and operational bottlenecks.  
The dashboard was built using **SQL** and **Power BI** to provide actionable insights about flight performance, cancellations, and delays across different time dimensions.

## 📊 Key Insights

### 🗓️ Flights by Month
- The number of flights fluctuates monthly, with peaks around **August (2591 flights)**.  
- Seasonal patterns suggest higher flight activity during summer months.

### ❌ Average Cancellations by Month
- The **highest cancellation rate** occurred in **June (6.1%)**, followed by **May (6.0%)**.  
- These spikes could be related to summer weather conditions or operational congestion.

### 🕒 Average Delays by Day of Week
- Both **departure** and **arrival delays** are relatively consistent across weekdays.  
- **Sunday (Day 7)** recorded the **highest average delay (87 mins)**, indicating heavier traffic or end-of-week congestion.

### 📅 Flights by Year
- The total number of flights shows slight variation across years:
  - 2015: 5,939  
  - 2016: 6,090 (Peak)  
  - 2019: 6,027  
- A general **upward trend** resumes in 2019 after minor drops in 2017–2018.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server** – Data extraction, transformation, and analysis  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and visualization  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and integration  
- **Excel / CSV** – Data source preparation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom measures and calculations

## ⚙️ SQL Analysis
Before creating the dashboard, SQL queries were used to:
- Calculate total flights, cancellations, and delays by month and year  
- Aggregate average departure and arrival delays  
- Prepare clean datasets for visualization in Power BI  

This preprocessing in SQL helped ensure accuracy and improved Power BI performance.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze flight performance trends over time  
- Identify high-cancellation and high-delay periods  
- Support data-driven decisions for airline operations and scheduling  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add weather impact correlation with delays  
- Include airline-level delay breakdown  
- Create predictive visuals for upcoming months based on historical data
